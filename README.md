**Numeria** is a fun and simple memory-based game where you uncover numbers in sequence from 1 to 25. It's a test of focus, patience, and memory skills, designed to challenge players of all ages. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s lightweight and easy to play.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game starts with a 5x5 grid containing hidden numbers from 1 to 25.
2. Uncover the numbers in the correct order, starting from 1.
3. If you click the wrong number:
   - All numbers hide again.
   - You restart from 1 (but the positions stay the same).
4. Use your memory to remember the positions and win by uncovering all numbers in sequence!
